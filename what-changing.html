			<p>Ashley Davis is the Coordinator for Undergraduate Recruitment and Career Services at the College of Education for University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). With a background in diversity, equity, justice and inclusion, she was able to lend her experience with diversity and inclusion efforts being made by the University. Davis is hopeful but critical of areas where the University must strive to make education more affordable for all students.</p>

			<p>According to Davis, the College of Education is made up mostly of White females, a demographic that does not necessarily reflect the demographics of the University as a whole. She says that although Education is making efforts to broaden their reach, the most significant barrier is tuition costs. She says the cost is prohibitive for everyone, not only students from historically marginalized communities, but that it is important to remember the historical context of opportunities which were afforded to certain people to get ahead. Davis is African American and says that for people like her, it is difficult to turn down a full-ride at another school just to come to UIUC.</p>

			<p>Davis is critical of ways in which the University has failed to make education more accessible and inclusive for students of color. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic when the University was provided with monetary relief from the federal government, UIUC did not take that opportunity to cut attendance costs, nor did they distribute those funds to students to the fullest possible extent. She also says in years past, the University provided free transportation for underrepresented students from Chicago to visit as a part of recruitment efforts. That was not done this year, something Davis calls “a big miss” being that it is “not a big cost for us with great results for us.”</p>

			<p>UIUC is a land-grant institution of Illinois, meaning the government reserved this land to educate people regardless of socioeconomic status. Because of this, the University is required to enroll a certain number of students from diverse, underrepresented backgrounds. Not only is it in the interest of the institution to ensure enrollment of different people with different experiences, but Davis says we need to make sure the experiences and stories of historically marginalized people are heard. Davis says if African Americans make up 13% of Illinois, they should make up 13% of Illinois’s land grant institution. Based on record high numbers of incoming freshmen in Fall of 2021, African Americans make up just 5% of the class. Davis calls this “a crisis.”</p>
