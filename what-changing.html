			<p>Ashley Davis is the Coordinator for Undergraduate Recruitment and Career Services at the College of Education for University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). With a background in diversity, equity, justice and inclusion, she was able to lend her experience with diversity and inclusion efforts being made by the University. Davis is hopeful but critical of areas where the University must strive to make education more affordable for all students.</p>

			<p>According to Davis, the College of Education is made up mostly of White females, a demographic that does not necessarily reflect the demographics of the University as a whole. She says that although Education is making efforts to broaden their reach, the most significant barrier is tuition costs. She says the cost is prohibitive for everyone, not only students from historically marginalized communities, but that it is important to remember the historical context of opportunities which were afforded to certain people to get ahead. Davis is African American and says that for people like her, it is difficult to turn down a full-ride at another school just to come to UIUC.</p>

			<p>Davis is critical of ways in which the University has failed to make education more accessible and inclusive for students of color. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic when the University was provided with monetary relief from the federal government, UIUC did not take that opportunity to cut attendance costs, nor did they distribute those funds to students to the fullest possible extent. She also says in years past, the University provided free transportation for underrepresented students from Chicago to visit as a part of recruitment efforts. That was not done this year, something Davis calls “a big miss” being that it is “not a big cost for us with great results for us.”</p>

			<p>UIUC is a land-grant institution of Illinois, meaning the government reserved this land to educate people regardless of socioeconomic status. Because of this, the University is required to enroll a certain number of students from diverse, underrepresented backgrounds. Not only is it in the interest of the institution to ensure enrollment of different people with different experiences, but Davis says we need to make sure the experiences and stories of historically marginalized people are heard. Davis says if African Americans make up 13% of Illinois, they should make up 13% of Illinois’s land grant institution. Based on record high numbers of incoming freshmen in Fall of 2021, African Americans make up just 5% of the class. Davis calls this “a crisis.”</p>

			<h1><span style="font-size: 36;">For LGBTQ+ researcher, change is personal</span></h1> 
			<h2><span style='font-size: 24;'>PhD candidate and education researcher Alexander Rosado-Torres</span></h2>

			<p>Alex Rosado-Torres is a second-year graduate student, first-year PhD student, and teaching assistant in the college of education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). His areas of study include Education Policy, Organization, & Leadership, a concentration in the History of Education, and a minor in Queer Studies.</p>

			<p> Rosado-Torres is currently pursuing a project titled “Oral Histories of LGBTQ+ Teachers of Color.” This project is aimed at gathering a collection of oral histories through interviews with LGBTQ+ people of color (POC) in the education field to document and contextualize their experiences. This work is personal for Rosado-Torres as a Queer POC who grew up attending underfunded public schools in New Jersey without the kind of Queer representation he hopes to see in the world. Given the current social climate in the United States, where anti-LGBTQ+ legislature and education policies are being passed in many states, Rosado-Torres feels it is important to look at the history of teachers as historical figures and value their role in society.</p>
	
			<p>This project was motivated by Rosado-Torres’s revelation about Queer POC’s absence in historical archives of educators. Even if they are there, an excavation of the archives must be done to find those individuals’ stories. He says, “we should be easily traceable, our lives should be… present and there should be robust accounts of our histories and our journeys and our triumphs.” Rosado-Torres’s goal with this project to be able to look back on his life and say he left a mark and hopes the same for other Queer educators of color. He also wants to make it possible for young people to see the endless opportunities available to them - he feels that as an educator it is his responsibility to do this work for future generations.</p>
	
			<p>Rosado-Torres chose UIUC because he valued attending a school where the work he desired to do was already taking place, somewhere with people advocating for change or social justice education movements. His department in the college of education, Education Policy, Organization, and Leadership, has a positive legacy of strong professors and leaders, Rosado-Torres says. They have laid a foundation to diversify what education research looks like, which is what attracted him to Illinois.</p>
	
			<p>Rosado-Torres feels change is happening, at UIUC and in Illinois at large. He mentions the act passed by Gov. Pritzker last year requiring Asian American history be taught at public K-12 schools. A bill was also just approved to ensure inclusion of LGBTQ histories in Illinois public school curriculums. In the college of education, Rosado-Torres says many faculty understand the situation we are living through and know how to support students through that. He says having this support makes it easier to do the work he is doing.</p>
