	    		<h1>Enrollment Data shows growing disparity in classes for future teachers dispite diversification efforts</h1>
	    	</div>

	    	<div class='article-content'>
	    		<p>The College of Education at the University of Illinois trains the next generation of teachers. These students will go on to represent professionalism, adulthood, maturity, and good behavior to millions of children in our K-12 school system. More importantly, they will be charged with the duty of acting as a role model for these students and a vital part of that duty is understanding the circumstances of each child’s life and representing their experiences and cultures.</p>

				<p>This is why it is so important to have a diverse, representative, and well-informed cohort of students graduating from the College of Education each year. We expect that each class of graduates from this school resemble the university at large and moreover the state of Illinois and the United States as a whole. Each class should be at least as diverse and all-encompassing as the schools they will teach in.</p>

	    	<div class='viz-description'>
	    		<p>Unfortunately, over the past nearly 20 years, there has been a growing divide in the student population of the College of Education relative to the rest of the University of Illinois. While there have been some success stories of growth and representation, the College of Education is failing to keep up with the diversity of the University, in fact it is becoming less diverse over time.</p>

				<p>We looked at the demographic breakdown of the College of Education compared to that of the University as a whole, over an 18-year period, from 2004 to 2022. We analyzed the 1700 students at the College of Education as a sample of the nearly 50,000 student population of the University and found growing disparity. We then compared relative percentages of each against each other. What we found was surprising but affirmed what we had heard from countless students in education programs.</p>

	    		<p>The graph to the right shows the percent difference between the baseline (university average) and the College of Education breakdown for each ethnic group over 36 semesters. A line along zero would mean that the percent of College of Education students in a certain ethnic group exactly matches the percent of students in that same ethnic group for the University. This data shows how far removed the College of Education is from the University in terms of the percentage of Asian students and white students.</p>

				<p>The data is clear, the College of Education has been, on average, about 20% more white and nearly 8% less Asian than the surrounding University.</p>

				<p>Seemingly, that divide has always been present, but what surprised us was the steady growth in separation between these two figures. We found that since 2004, on average the College of Education has been growing an additional 1% more white and 1% less Asian than the University about every 3 years.</p>

				<p>That alone is an astounding figure.</p>
	    	</div>

		    <div class='article-content'>
		    	<p>Oddly, the percentage of students enrolled at the College of Education who identify as white has decreased over our 18-year analysis period. Down more than 20 points since 2004, from 82% to 60%. However, the University has seen a decrease as well, and a more dramatic one than the College of Education, from 68% to 40%, a nearly 30-point change in less than 20 years.</p>

				<p>We drew several conclusions from this data. Firstly, while the College of Education’s white majority has decreased, it remains a solid majority, even as the University sees only a plurality of white students in its population. Secondly, even as the College of Education’s percentage of white students has decreased, it has not decreased as rapidly as the University as a whole, leaving an even wider gap than before. Finally, since the University is outpacing the College of Education in its diversification, the College of Education remains around 20% more white than the University.</p>

				<p>We began looking deeper into these numbers. Since 2004, the University of Illinois has seen a steady increase of its enrollment of Asian American students, equal to an increase of nearly 10 points over 18 years, from 13% in 2004 to 21% in 2022. However, the College of Education has stagnated, growing slightly but hovering at around 8% over the same period.</p>

				<p>What we find from our analysis is a failure by the College of Education to keep up with University diversification efforts. Even as the College of Education attempts to enroll more non-white students, it fails to meet or exceed the level of the University average.</p>

	    		<h1>Enrollment data shares some success stories for Black, Hispanic education students</h1>
	    	</div>

	    	<div class='article-content'>
	    		<p>However, the news isn’t all bad for the College of Education, which has seen a couple success stories in other areas of its diversity. These successes are likely tied to a greater emphasis on outreach to underrepresented students in the 2010s. One such outreach program was called the “Inclusive Illinois Initiative” which sought to find “innovative” solutions and enhancements for the University of Illinois’s “outreach to African American and Latinx students.”</p>

				<p>That program continues to this day and saw some areas of success in outputs from its goal. Not only did the University reach more Black and Hispanic students, but they also enrolled. And seemingly, they enrolled in Education curricula. The College of Education saw an enormous boost during this period, as more and more Black and Hispanic students sought teaching a profession.</p>

				<p>In our analysis period, University-wide, the percentage of students identifying as Hispanic rose 8 points, from 6% to 14%. That number was outpaced by the College of Education in 2015, with a higher percentage of Hispanic students enrolling in the College of Education than the University as a whole for the first time. That trend continues to this day, and is only growing.</p>

		    	<p>Meanwhile, even as the percentage of Black students enrolled at the University stays fairly steady at around 6%, the College of Education has jumped from a huge deficit to nearly matching that percentage for more than 5 years. The change was rapid, within three semesters the College of Education went from enrolling Black students as less than 2% of its population to more than 6%. The College of Education jumped from a 3-point deficit under the University average to enrolling a higher percentage of Black students than the University in two academic years.</p>

				<p>Today, the College of Education continues to nearly match the University’s percentage of Black students every semester, never seeing more than a 1-point difference in more than 5 years.</p>

				<p>There’s still work to be done, and as the University of Illinois continues to diversify, we hope to see an equal growth across all programs. Especially for our classes of future teachers, whose experiences, cultural understanding, and diversity will better educate, inform, and inspire the children of tomorrow.</p>
